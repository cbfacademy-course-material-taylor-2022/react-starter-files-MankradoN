# üéâ React Starter Files!

This repository, set up as a simple [monorepo](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/what-monorepo#what), is your starting point. Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up your local development environment, and get ready for some fun!

## üõ†Ô∏è Set Up Your Local Development Environment

1. **Fork This Repository:** Click the 'Fork' button at the top of this repository to create a copy under your personal account.

2. **Navigate to Your Projects Directory:** Before cloning, on your computer ensure that you're in the directory that holds all of your projects. You can navigate to this directory using the `cd` command. For instance, if your projects are in a directory named 'Projects', you would use:

```sh
cd ~/Projects
```

3. **Clone The Forked Repository:** Now, let's clone the forked repository onto your local machine. Replace `{your_github_username}` with your actual Github username (for example, 'janesmith'). Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:{your_github_username}/react-starter-files.git
```

This command will create a new directory called `react-starter-files` within your current directory and will clone the repository into this new directory.

4. **Navigate Into Your Cloned Repository:** If you want to navigate into your new repository, use:

```sh
cd react-starter-files
```

5. **Install Dependencies:** While inside your project's root directory, install all the necessary dependencies using this command:

```sh
npm install
```

Now, you're ready to dive into individual tasks! üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## üß≠ How to Navigate Through Tasks

Each task comes with its own dedicated folder. To work on a task, you'll need to navigate to its folder. For example, if you're working on the "build-a-car" task, you would enter its directory using the command `cd build-a-car`.

After entering the specific task's directory, you can initiate the development environment. Simply run the following command from inside the task's directory:

```sh
npm run start
```

(Note: Make sure to replace "build-a-car" with the name of the task you're currently tackling.)

Happy Coding! üöÄ
